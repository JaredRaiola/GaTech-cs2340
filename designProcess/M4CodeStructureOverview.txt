Refactored Code in M4:

           Moved many error checking functions to GameData to allow for more reuse between controllers


Newly added Features in M4:

      backend dice roll calulations added to AttackController
              getAttackLosses, attackDiceLossTuple, getDiceRollArray private funtions to handle calulations and data updates
      GameData now contains Arrays of Attack and Defence dice rolls
               attackDiceRoll
               defenceDiceRoll
               these variables are used to display dice rolls to the user and to work with army loss calulations in AttackController
      Attacking is fully implemented with proper error checking, according to the rules outlines in the project outlines



Other Notes:

      Mysterious scala style error present in every file "String index out of range: -1"
